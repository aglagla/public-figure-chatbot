The Young Feynman 

‚Ä¢ Richard (Dick) Feynman was born May 11, 1918 in Far 

Rockaway, Queens, NY. 

‚Ä¢ His parents were Jewish and from Russia and Poland. 
‚Ä¢ As a child he was taught by his father to take independent 

viewpoints on things. 

‚Ä¢ He repaired radios as a youth, as he could figure out what was 

wrong with them. 

‚Ä¢ He learned calculus at 15. 
‚Ä¢ As a senior in high school, he won the NYU Math Challenge. 

Feynman‚Äôs Education and the Manhattan Project 
‚Ä¢ He was an undergraduate at MIT and graduated in 1939. 
‚Ä¢ He was a graduate student of John Wheeler‚Äôs at Princeton, 

where he already did advanced work on Quantum 
Electrodynamics (QED), and received his Ph.D. in 1942. 
‚Ä¢ His physics prowess was becoming well known, and he was 
brought to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos to work 
with Hans Bethe. 

‚Ä¢ There he became head of computing, and developed 

important codes and oversaw their parallel computing farm 
of ladies on calculators. 

Dick and Arline 
‚Ä¢ He married his high school sweetheart 

Arline Greenbaum when he received his 
Ph.D., although she was seriously ill 
with tuberculosis. 

‚Ä¢ She was very artistic and musical. 
‚Ä¢ He brought Arline to a hospital in Santa 
Fe and would visit her on weekends. 
She died in 1945. 

‚Ä¢ This period was portrayed in the movie 
‚ÄúInfinity‚Äù in 1996, starring and directed 
by Matthew Broderick.

Feynman and Path Integrals 

‚Ä¢

I read Quantum Man by Lawrence Krauss for the story of the 
physics that Feynman developed and worked on. 

‚Ä¢ After the war, Feynman was recruited by many universities 
and decided to go to Cornell to work with Hans Bethe. 
‚Ä¢ There he developed his new Path Integral formulation of 

Quantum Mechanics. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman didn‚Äôt really use this to rigorously develop his 

diagrams or rules, so we put that in an appendix. 

‚Ä¢ We do teach the Path Integral formulation in graduate courses 

to show students how Feynman rules can be derived, 
however. 

Light as Waves and Particles Called Photons 

‚Ä¢ The connection of particle and wave properties of light was 

discovered by Max Planck. 

‚Ä¢ He connected the energy E of the particles of light, called 

photons, with the frequency of their wave oscillations, ùúà, by 

 E = ‚Ñé ùúà where ‚Ñé is called Planck‚Äôs constant. 
‚Ä¢ This is also the relation used by Einstein in explaining the 
photoelectric effect, where single electrons are ejected 
from a solid when light hits it. 

The Scale of Quantum Mechanics 

‚Ä¢ We will use a more convenient quantity ‚Äúhbar‚Äù, where 
 ‚Ñè = ‚Ñé / (2 ùúã). 
‚Ä¢ Since ‚Ñè usually occurs multiplied by the speed of light c, we 

show their combined values in useful units: 

 ‚Ñè c = 0.2 GeV fm = 2 keV A‚Å∞. 
‚Ä¢ A Fermi, fm is about the size of a proton, and a GeV (billion 

electron Volts) is about the mass of the proton. 

‚Ä¢ An Angstrom A‚Å∞ is about the size of an atom, and a keV is a 

scale for energy levels of electrons in heavy atoms. 

Relativity and Quantum Mechanics 
‚Ä¢ The first great discoveries of combining relativity and QM was 
found by P. A. M. Dirac, which in his Dirac equation discovered 
both antiparticles, and that electrons had spin 1/2, in units of 
‚Ñè. 

‚Ä¢ Previous QM work showed that orbital angular momentum in 
atoms had only integer values, 0,1,2,3, etc. in units of ‚Ñè, that 
classified atomic levels. 

‚Ä¢ The spin ¬Ω electron, means that no two electrons can occupy 
the same state, and leads to the shell model of atoms, the 
periodic table, chemistry, and eventually, life. 

‚Ä¢ This is called the Pauli Exclusion Principle. 

Paul Dirac and Antiparticles with Negative Energy 

Paul Dirac 

The Relativistic Energy Momentum 
Relation is: 
E¬≤ = (mc¬≤)¬≤ + p¬≤c¬≤. 
Note, at rest, the momentum p=0, 
and therefore, 
E= ¬±mc¬≤. The negative energy 
solutions are those for antiparticles, 
since they also have the opposite 
charge from the positive energy 
solutions. 

Feynman Diagrams 

‚Ä¢ Feynman formulated the quantum theory of interacting 
electrons and electromagnetic fields called Quantum 
Electrodynamics in his path integral approach. 

‚Ä¢ The electromagnetic fields could act as particles in the 

photoelectric effect, as explained by Einstein. These are 
called photons. 

‚Ä¢ By working many examples of processes, Feynman realized a 
great simplicity: that he could formulate a set of rules for 
writing the results without deriving each one. 

‚Ä¢ This opened up the ability to calculate to everybody. 
‚Ä¢ Feynman also drew diagrams that showed physically how the 

processes occurred. 

‚Ä¢ This has been applied to all of the new theories of current and 

proposed new particles and interactions. 

Feynman Diagrams for QED 

‚Ä¢The lowest order diagram in the strength of 
the interaction, which is the electron charge 
‚Äúe‚Äù. For exchange of a photon, each 
connection is given by e, and the product is 
scaled to the dimensionless constant 
 Œ± = e¬≤/‚Ñèc = 1/137.036 
 which is called the fine structure constant. 
‚Ä¢The processes in QED are an expansion in 
powers of Œ± with an extra exchanged photon 
for each additional order or power of alpha. 

First and Second Order 
QED Feynman Diagrams 
for electron-electron scattering. 

Second order diagrams have 
two photons exchanged. 

Feynman Rules for QED 
‚Ä¢ Feynman‚Äôs rules give a free particle solution to the Dirac equation 
for each incoming and outgoing free electron, and a solution to 
Maxwell‚Äôs equations for each free photon. 

‚Ä¢ At each vertex of an electron with a photon is a photon source J, 

called an interaction. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman propagator functions connect each exchanged photon to 

its current source and absorption vertexes, and each electron 
between photon. 

‚Ä¢ There is also a ‚ÄúDirac delta function‚Äù that guarantees that energy 

and momentum are conserved exactly at each vertex. 

‚Ä¢ Because of that, energy and momentum are conserved for each 

diagram from start to finish. 

‚Ä¢ The oft made statement that energy can fluctuate in a process 
should really be that the intermediate particles are virtual, and 
don‚Äôt have the right connection of energy and momentum to 
escape as free particles. 

Freeman Dyson, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga 

Freeman Dyson showed in 1948 that Feynman‚Äôs diagrams 
and rules for calculation were the same as the Field Theory 
approaches of Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. 

Antiparticles as Negative Energy Solutions 

‚Ä¢

In these rules, Feynman interpreted the negative energy solutions 
as particles moving backwards in time. 

‚Ä¢ This got rid of the earlier interpretation where antiparticles were 

‚Ä¢

holes in a filled sea of negative energy particles that permeated all 
of space-time, the so-called Dirac sea. 
In propagation of photons between the source electron and the 
absorbing electron, both time orderings of emission and absorption 
could be included relativistically, in a ‚Äúpropagator‚Äù function that 
was developed in Feynman‚Äôs thesis with John Wheeler. 
‚Ä¢ These had also been developed independently by E. C. G 

Stueckelberg, but not exploited as Feynman did.

Feynman Moves to CalTech 

In 1950, Feynman was offered a position at CalTech. 

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ Before going there he took a half year off to relax in Rio in 

Brazil, where he taught Physics and learned to play the bongo 
drums. 

‚Ä¢ From 1952 to 56 he was married to Mary Louise Bell, but that 
did not turn out to be a good match, since he worked all of 
the time. 

‚Ä¢ After that, on a trip to Switzerland, he met the British 

Gweneth Howard, and hired her as an au pair. 

‚Ä¢ He married her in 1960, and they had a son Carl and an 

adopted daughter, Michelle. 

Feynman‚Äôs Van and Family 

Superfluid Helium, Superconductivity and Weak 
Interactions 

‚Ä¢ Besides particle physics, Feynman worked on Superfluid 

Helium. He treated it as a ‚ÄúBose-Einstein‚Äù condensate, in 
which all He atoms of zero angular momentum could be in 
the same state and act alike at low temperatures as free 
particles. 

‚Ä¢ He also worked on Superconductivity, where he discovered 

and worked on vortices as the excitations in the 
superconductor. 

‚Ä¢ With Murray Gell-Mann at CalTech, he formulated the 

theory for the weak interactions, which was like QED, but 
including another current that violated parity maximally, 
called the ‚ÄúV-A‚Äù theory. It used only left spinning electrons, 
and right spinning positrons. 

Feynman and Nanotechnology 

‚Ä¢In 1959 Feynman gave a lecture 
speculating on manipulation and 
building machines on the atomic or 
molecular scale, which is now known 
as nanotechnology. 
‚Ä¢The title of the talk was ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs 
Plenty of Room at the Bottom‚Äù. 
‚Ä¢Today we can see and move individual 
atoms with atomic force microscopes. 
‚Ä¢He also covered microscopic data 
storage, microscopic motors, and 
quantum engineering. 

The Feynman Lectures 

‚Ä¢ By 1961, Feynman got very interesting in teaching, and 

presenting his own unique outlook on basic physics subjects. 

‚Ä¢ He taught Freshman and then Sophomore physics, and his 
notes were compiled by Robert B. Leighton and Matthew 
Sands 

‚Ä¢ The lectures were not only complete, but added analyses of 
many phenomena in a simple, Feynman way. You can almost 
hear Feynman speaking in the syntax used. 

The Feynman Lectures 

‚Ä¢ The lectures were published as the Feynman Lectures in 

Physics in three red volumes (list copied from Wikipedia): 

‚Ä¢ Volume 1: Mechanics, radiation and heat. 
‚Ä¢ Volume 2: Electromagnetism and matter. 
‚Ä¢ Volume 3: Quantum mechanics.

‚ÄúThe Character of Physical Law‚Äù Messenger Lectures 

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

In 1964 he went to Cornell to give seven Messenger lectures, which were 
recorded on film. They are titled ‚ÄúThe Character of Physical Law‚Äù. 
In 2009, Bill Gates obtained the rights to these and put them on the web 
for free as ‚ÄúProject Tuva‚Äù. They can be viewed on Windows with special 
software including notes. The lectures are titled (copied from Wikipedia): 

‚Ä¢ The law of gravitation, an example of physical law 
‚Ä¢ The relation of mathematics to physics 
‚Ä¢ The great conservation principles 
‚Ä¢ Symmetry in physical law 
‚Ä¢ The distinction of past and future 
‚Ä¢ Probability and uncertainty - the quantum mechanical view of 

nature

‚Ä¢ Start of Feynman Lecture on Quantum Mechanics 

Feynman Lectures on Gravitation 
In 1962 to 1963, Feynman turned to Gravity, which had only 
been dealt with classically before. 

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ He quantized gravity, with the graviton being the quantum of 

the gravitational field radiation. 

‚Ä¢ He laid out the Feynman rules for gravity and did the second 

order calculation, discovering the bad infinities, that have only 
been dealt with now with supersymmetric string theory. 
‚Ä¢ He also realized the possibility of a zero net energy universe, 
which is now part of the inflation model of the start of the 
universe. 

‚Ä¢ His lectures at CalTech on this were not published as a book 

until 1995. 

1965 Nobel Prize in 
Physics 
In 1965 the Nobel Prize in 
Physics was awarded for 
the development of QED to 
Feynman, Schwinger, and 
Tomonaga.

‚Ä¢Around 1962 Feynman took up 
art to express the deep emotions 
that he felt about nature. 
‚Ä¢His drawings can be seen on the 
www.museumsyndicate.com 
website. 
‚Ä¢He used the pseudonym Ofey 
after the French ‚Äúau Fait‚Äù, 
meaning ‚Äúit is done‚Äù. 
‚Ä¢This one is called ‚ÄúEquations 
and Sketches‚Äù.

Feynman and Computing ‚Äì Stephen Wolfram 
From 1981-85 Feynman worked on questions of computer simulation, 
parallel processor computation, pattern recognition, and computability of 
physics problems. 

‚Ä¢ He also wrote about quantum element computation. 
‚Ä¢ He worked on cellular automata or schemes of cellular nodes evolving in 

time with certain rules. 

‚Ä¢ He helped inspire Stephen Wolfram to program a computer to do algebra, 

‚Ä¢

which became the Mathematica software and company. 
This has expanded to the all data app called ‚ÄúWolfram alpha‚Äù on iPhones, 
and a principal source for Siri.

Frozen Pancakes and Partons 

‚Ä¢ SLAC was scattering electrons off of 
protons at high energy, or short 
wavelength, of the virtual photons 
given off by the deflected electrons. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman realized that passing a 

proton at high speed meant that the 
proton would Lorentz contract and 
look like a pancake. 

‚Ä¢ Also, clocks in the proton would 

appear to slow down, called time 
dilation, so the constituents of the 
proton, called partons, would appear 
to not be interacting, and would act 
as free particles, frozen in place.

‚Ä¢

 The process would essentially 
take an instantaneous picture of 
the proton at high resolution, 
with the constituents frozen. 
‚Ä¢ The momentum of the partons 
was along the same direction as 
the proton, but with a fraction 
of the total momentum called x 
‚Ä¢ Pparton = x Pproton, where x runs 

from 0 to 1. 

Partons as Quarks 

‚Ä¢

 Since the scattering was due to 
photons, the amount of scattering or 
effective ‚Äúcross section‚Äù of the proton 
for scattering, would be due to the 
square of the charge of each parton. 
‚Ä¢ The fractional (+2/3 e) charge for an up 
quark parton, and (-1/3 e) for a down 
quark parton, was then revealed, and 
the partons could be identified as GellMann and Zweig‚Äôs quarks. 
‚Ä¢ Rather than just a mathematical 

underpinning of particle symmetries, 
the quarks were real particles! 

Parton Distribution Functions 

‚Ä¢ Up and down quarks in the 

proton forming its core are called 
valence partons (uud), and have 
the parton x distributions u and d 
in the figure (multiplied by x). 
‚Ä¢ Virtual gluons can also create 
pairs of u, d, and s quarks and 
antiquarks, forming a sea of 
quarks, with a distributions 
labeled by u and d with bars, and 
s. 

‚Ä¢ Gluons frozen in the picture of 

scattering have the distribution g, 
which show up in strong 
interaction scattering.

Richard Taylor, Jerome Friedman, and Henry Kendall 

Other Discoveries of Free Particle Scattering 

‚Ä¢ The effective results of the free parton scattering 
were previously inferred through an abstract 
Current Algebra approach by James Bjorken at SLAC 
before the results came in. So it is called FeynmanBjorken scaling. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman‚Äôs genius of simplicity was to see that the 
scattering was due to a free parton, and that the 
value for x could be derived from the scattering 
energy and momentum in a few lines. 

‚Ä¢ The parton distribution functions are also used in 
proton-proton scattering, and in all high energy 
processes.

Feynman Diagrams Today 

Higgs from gluon fusion 

‚Ä¢ Today, Feynman Diagrams are 

used for Weak, Electromagnetic 
and Strong interactions at high 
energy. 
 They can be calculated to high 
order using formulas based on the 
preceding order. 

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢ They are now generated by 
computer and calculated by 
computer. 

‚Ä¢ Monte Carlo programs are written 

for various experiments that 
calculate the number of events 
that are expected in an 
experiment from the diagrams. 

Automated Theory to Experiment via Feynman Diagrams 

The Challenger Space Shuttle Rogers Commission 

‚Ä¢

In January 18, 1986 the space shuttle Challenger exploded 
while in the booster rocket phase, and Feynman was 
appointed to the Rogers Commission to examine the cause 
and increase the safety of the space shuttle. 

‚Ä¢ The solid booster rocket was actually put together from 

several pieces, sealed by two O rings around the 
circumference. 

‚Ä¢ Engineers had pointed out problems with this to 

management, but they delayed in instituting fixes. 

Feynman‚Äôs Demonstration 

‚Ä¢ But the day of the launch the 

‚Ä¢

temperature was as low as 8‚Å∞ F. 
In the Congressional hearing in 
February, Feynman rustled together a 
small O ring and ice to show how it 
would freeze and not expand to seal 
the joints. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman accepted this responsibility 
even though he was already very ill 
with cancer. 

Feynman‚Äôs Report on Safety and Management 

‚Ä¢ The joints also were pulled apart by twisting 
and expansion of the booster segments. 
‚Ä¢ This caused the escaping flame to burn the 

lower booster attachment, open a hole to the 
hydrogen tank in the external fuel tank, and 
the booster to detach, resulting in disaster. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman also wrote an appendix F to the 
report where he discussed problems with 
estimating safety levels and examined the 
safety of all of the systems of the shuttle. 
‚Ä¢ He also pointed out that management was 

always increasing the safety levels 
determined by engineers by factors of a 
hundred or a thousand. 

How Feynman Viewed Physics: 
as a lot of interconnected subjects that affected each 
other. 

Feynman‚Äôs Departure and Legacy 

In 1987 he had a recurrence and another rare cancer. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman contracted a rare cancer in 1979. 
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ Despite this he kept working out of interest. 
‚Ä¢ He died in on Feb. 15, 1988 at the age of 69. 
‚Ä¢ Feynman on Science and Living With Uncertainty 
‚Ä¢

It is clear that Feynman inspired a spirit of independent 
thinking in all fields, and a spirit of striving for and finding the 
simplest ways of understanding and explaining science. 

Feynman Web Sources 

‚Ä¢ Googling Feynman will turn up many sites devoted to 

him as well as Wikipedia articles and the Wikiquotes site. 

‚Ä¢ There are also interviews with him on YouTube. 
‚Ä¢ We already mentioned the Messenger lectures on the

‚Ä¢ There are many books that he wrote and that were written 

about him that are shown on the next slides. Feynman was a 
great story teller.

Technical Appendices 

Technical Appendix: The Action in Physics 

‚Ä¢ Difficult classical physics problems are solved by minimizing the 

‚Äúaction‚Äù S which is defined as the sum (integral) over time, over a 
path, of the kinetic energy (K.E.) minus the potential energy (P.E.): 

 S = ‚ÖÄ ( K.E. ‚Äí P.E.) ‚àÜt 
‚Ä¢ Traveling on a level surface with no P.E., for a car, say, 
 S = K.E. ¬∑ time 
‚Ä¢ So the principal of least action for a drive means minimizing the 

time it takes, something we intuitively do all the time. 

‚Ä¢ For QED, the action S includes includes the interaction of the 

electron current eJ with the electromagnetic field A: 

 eJ¬∑A, where e is the charge of the electron. 

Technical Appendix: The Sum over Paths, or Path Integral 

‚Ä¢

In Quantum Mechanics, a particle is also a wave, which travels over 
many paths. 

‚Ä¢ Feynman looked at QM by summing over all possible paths that a 
particle could take, allowing wavelike interference by using as a 
phase the action S/‚Ñè on that path, in B. For those paths for which S 
is very near its minimum, they all have almost the same value of S, 
and they interfere constructively, thereby giving the classical path, 
and explaining the classical Principle of Least Action, which is 
equivalent to Newton‚Äôs Law, but used for complex problems. 

Classical Path 

Quantum Paths 

The Generation of Feynman Graphs in QED 

‚Ä¢ The action enters in an exponential function as a phase: 
 exp( i S / ‚Ñè ). 
‚Ä¢ When the exp function is expanded it is a series in all 

powers in S, or all powers of the interaction vertex eJ¬∑A. 

‚Ä¢ Thus all orders of photon exchange are included. 
‚Ä¢ Since each photon exchange has two currents, one at each 
end, it is a series in order of e¬≤ or Œ± = e¬≤/‚Ñèc. Since Œ± is 
small it is called a perturbation series, and only a few terms 
are usually needed. 

‚Ä¢ A produced photon would have just one current eJ¬∑A, and A 

would be the photon‚Äôs outgoing wave function. 

Technical Appendix: Removing the infinities 

‚Ä¢ The higher order diagrams in QED had mild infinities. 
‚Ä¢ Feynman first formulated a high energy cutoff, that could be 

due to unknown physics at very short distances. 

‚Ä¢ He then showed that some infinities could be cancelled, and 
others absorbed by replacing the bare or input masses and 
charges by their physical values. 

‚Ä¢ He published this in 1949. 
‚Ä¢ His colleague and friend Freeman Dyson showed that this 

could work to all orders. 

Technical Appendix: Parton Math and Scaling 
‚Ä¢ With the proton having momentum p, the parton having momentum xp, 
and the photon having momentum q, the scattered parton has final 
momentum (xp + q). 
The condition that it be a free particle is (q + x p)¬≤ =m¬≤. 

‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ Multiplying this out we have q¬≤ + 2 x p‚ãÖq + x¬≤ p¬≤ =m¬≤ 
‚Ä¢ Now p‚ãÖq = mùúà = m (E-E‚Äô) (in the lab frame), where E is the incoming 

electron energy, and E‚Äô is the outgoing electron energy. 

 q¬≤ + 2xp‚ãÖq = 0, or: q¬≤ + 2xmùúà = 0. 
therefore, x = -q¬≤ /(2mŒΩ) , the Bjorken or Feynman x! 

‚Ä¢ At large q¬≤ and ŒΩ we ignore p¬≤ and m¬≤, giving 
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢ With k the incoming electron momentum, and k‚Äô the outgoing electron‚Äôs , 
‚Ä¢ q¬≤ = (k ‚Äì k‚Äô)¬≤ = -2k¬∑k‚Äô = -2 E E‚Äô (1‚Äí cos ùúÉ) where ùúÉ is the electron 

‚Ä¢

scattering angle. 
Experiments summing over all hadron final states of the same x should 
have the same result, even for different values of q¬≤ and ùúà, as long as they 
give the same ratio x. 

‚Ä¢ This is called Feynman-Bjorken scaling.
